things to do:
-------------
consider espconn_find_connection

make a mdns routine that really builds the message
queuelength is maxtcpcon
only accept pair-setup URL if pairing
replace plink_active with my own linked list of pcryp
fix issue of notes8a.txt
remove existing connections coming from the same IP when new connection

keepalive doesn't kill because events keep it awake or it is just broken!
use state=4 as criterion not to send more...

make the callback routine responsible for init etc. by using a param to be multiuse
unify all sends into data_send
use vTaskList to find stack usage
already prepare accessory message while verifying signature
store clientkeys in an encrypted format
make remove invited key more robust
swap buffer for encrypt input with output and then it can grow what is needed
do encryption concatenation backward so you need a 0x400 input buffer max
verify is calculation of len in decrypt is OK, should be shifting with loop, right?
set clockspeed to 160MHz at crypto moments
after deleteing a guest, track down existing TCP sessions and kill those
if tcp not encrypted within 2 seconds, close it
gpio stuff can be done without driver stuff??
make sendbuffer before encrypt more automatic instead of +2x0x18
is this working well? Key 1 was disabled only once....?
204ABCDE-F012-3456-7890-ABCDEF012345 -- 7fffffffffffffffffffffff3230
764ABCDE-F012-3456-7890-ABCDEF012345 -- 7f7fffffffffffffffffffff3736
9A4ABCDE-F012-3456-7890-ABCDEF012345 -- 3f7fffffffffffffffffffff3941
key 2 loaded - result: 0

Doing
-----

DONE
----
when disconnect, remove the event flag
if not encrypted, do not accept json messages
get random keys in place
change v for B in crytoinit
make SRP step 1 part of init in case of pairing
get debug printing conditional
implement GET /characteristics
make multiple clients work in parallel
event message
implement GET /identify
identify before pair
make an 'update' routine
make the setup of a characteristic a routine with some params
unify all routines in one file an make it a library
consider vTaskdelay in mdns loop
change decrypt out buffer from objects[3] to a dynamic buffer (if too big)
make pairing variables dynamic, not global
and do something usefull with this foundation ;-)

not possible
------------
store myusername and mykey and peerkey in RTC-flash -- it is not flash but ram
make task stack value 256 instead of 2560 -- crashes and didn't make an advantage in heap report
